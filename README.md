# Data-Structures
Contains implementation of basic data structers and also algorithms which solves TSP and Knapsack problems.
<hr>
All of that projects I implemented on fourth semester.<br>
Folder "Data Structures Implementation" contains implementation of basic data structures: Array, List, Binary Heap. <br>
Folder "Graph Algorithms" contains algorithms for finding minimum spanning tree: Prim and Kruskal algorithms, and algorithms for solving TSP problem: Bellman-Ford and Djikstra algorithms. <br>
Folder "TSP and Knapsack" contains bruteforce and greedy algorithms for TSP and Knapsack problems.
